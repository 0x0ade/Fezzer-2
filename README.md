# Fezzer-2
Built for compatibilty with FezMod, Fezzer 2 is a Fez Asset Editor

To use, you need to extract the game's resources. Do this using FezParse (https://github.com/fesh0r/xnb_parse)
Then simply edit the Resource Path parameter on the LevelImported script to wherever your FezParse folder is located. (For example, F:/Users/[username]/Documents/FezParse/")
